            <h1>Getting Started</h1>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Slides are simple HTML. In order to get started …
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Copy this <a href="https://github.com/DennisSchulmeister/ls-presentation-template">template project</a></li>
                    <li>Edit the file <tt>static/index.html</tt></li>
                    <li>Build the presentation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In order to build the presentation run any of these:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For development: <tt>npm run devserver</tt></li>
                    <li>For deployment: <tt>npm run build</tt></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The last command will run a local webserver on port 8080.
                    Open <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>
                    to access it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Getting started with lecture-slide.js is easy. At least if you
                    know a little bit HTML and if you are not afraid of running
                    a command-line tool on your computer. Take this presentation,
                    for example. It is contained in a single HTML file. And all
                    it takes to build the final presentation is a simple command
                    in your operating system's command line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But first things first. In order to get started you need to
                    create a little structure on your computer. This is you need
                    to create a directory which must contain a certain set of given
                    files. Basically there are many ways, how this can be done
                    and each has its own merits. But here I show you a way which
                    is both simple and yet powerful. This means it will grow with
                    your needs as you keep going on.
                </p>

                <h2>Getting the template project</h2>

                <p>
                    There is already a ready-to-run <a href="https://github.com/DennisSchulmeister/ls-presentation-template">template project</a>
                    on Github. So to start, visit the link and download its content.
                    This can be done with the green <i>Clone or download</i> button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Clone or download » Download ZIP</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Extract the ZIP file anywhere on your computer. That's all.
                    So let's take a look, what to do next.
                </p>

                <h2>Writing your slides</h2>

                <p>
                    Now it is time to write your slides, which are just plain HTML
                    files in the <tt>static</tt> directory. So go there and open
                    up the file <tt>static/index.html</tt> in any code editor of
                    your liking. There you will see the code if this presentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After you made yourself comfortable with the file content,
                    start hacking right away. Create as many <tt>&lt;section&gt;</tt>
                    elements as you wish. Each one will become a slide. And don't
                    forget to put the following content in it:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <tt>&lt;h1&gt;</tt>: This is the slide title
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <tt>&lt;article&gt;</tt>: This is the slide itself
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <tt>&lt;aside&gt;</tt>: This is the detail explanation you
                        are currently reading.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Each one of these is optional. But when they are all present
                    the final result should look something like this:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <tt>
                        &lt;section&gt;<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt; <br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;article&gt;Slide content&lt;/article&gt; <br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;aside&gt;Detailed explanation&lt;/aside&gt; <br />
                        &lt;/section&gt;
                    </tt>
                </p>

                <h2>Building and running the presentation</h2>
                <p>
                    Now open a terminal window and go to the directory where
                    your presentation lives. When you are there, run one of the
                    following two commands, depending on what you want to do:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For development: <tt>npm run devserver</tt></li>
                    <li>For deployment: <tt>npm run build</tt></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Use the first command while you're still writing your slides.
                    It will start a local webserver which can be accessed at
                    <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>.
                    When you made changes to your slides simply press <tt>F5</tt>
                    on or two times to reload the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once your done, run the second command. It will create the
                    final version ready to copy onto any webserver. The files
                    will be in the <tt>build</tt> directory. Just push them on
                    a webserver and call it a day. It really doesn't have to be
                    a special server. Even the most simple one will do.
                </p>

                <hr />

                <p>
                    <b>Note:</b> In case your slides don't seem to work after
                    you put them on a server, you most likeley have put them into
                    a sub-directory. This is, your URL is not
                    <a href="http://www.example.com/">http://www.example.com/</a>
                    but maybe <a href="http://www.example.com/slides/">http://www.example.com/slides/</a>.
                    In that case edit the file <tt>package.json</tt> and search
                    for the following line:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <tt>"public_url": "",</tt>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Change it to the following, rebuild the slides and upload
                    them again. Now everything should be fine:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <tt>"public_url": "/slides/",</tt>
                </p>

            <h1>Translating the User Interface</h1>
            <article>
                <p>
                    This presentation is in English. So it makes sense that the
                    buttons to navigate from slide to slide are English, too.
                    If you want to change that:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Edit the file <tt>index.js</tt></li>
                    <li>Translate the <tt>label…</tt> values there</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    For example in German:
                </p>
                <tt>
                    import SlideshowPlayer from "lecture-slides.js";<br />
                    <br />
                    window.addEventListener("load", () => {<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let player = new SlideshowPlayer({<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;labelPrev: <b>"Zurück"</b>,<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;labelNext: <b>"Weiter"</b>,<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;labelGoTo: <b>"Gehe zu"</b>,<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;labelOverview: <b>"Übersicht"</b>,<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;labelPresentationMode: <b>"Präsentationsmodus"</b>,<br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mode: "slideshow",<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});<br />
                        <br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;player.start();<br />
                    });<br />
                </tt>
